# General-Algorithms
Implementation of different algorithms

## **Infos about the project**
The different algorithms in this repository have been collected around the internet with the objective to create a catalog of tested and functioning algorithms.
I have included, in every file, an header with general infos about the algorithm (time complexity...) .

The final goal of this project is to improve my overall skills in competitive programming, by learning new methods (and approches) to solve different problems

## **Structure**
Every category of algorithms is divided in directories, and every directory contains the algorithms in two forms, one optimized for competitve programming the other for learnig how the code works (the time complexity is the same, the only thing that changes is the structure of the code. The optimized can be written faster).
