# General-Algorithms
Implementation of different algorithms

## **Infos about the project**
The different algorithms in this repository have been collected around the internet with the objective to create a catalog of tested and functioning algorithms.
I have included, in every file, an header with general infos about the algorithm (time complexity...) .

The final goal of this project is to improve my overall skills in competitive programming, by learning new methods (and approches) to solve different problems
